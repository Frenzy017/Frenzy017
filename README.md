## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a professional esports freelance coach and an aspiring front-end developer.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently applying for intern software developer jobs as I work through the Odin Project's [**React Course**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#react-js).

ðŸŒ± Right now I'm learning React so I can create a polished To-Do list and other cool projects I have in mind :)

> The Odin Project is a free, open-source curriculum for learning modern web development which teaches you by reading plently of docs, going through personal projects and more!
