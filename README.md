## Hi there 👋

I'm Alex, an aspiring Front-End developer.

🔭 I’m currently applying for intern software developer jobs as I work through the Odin Project's [**React Course**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs).
🌱 I’m currently learning React so I can create a polished To-Do list and other cool projects I have in mind :)

> The Odin Project is a free, open-source curriculum for learning modern web development which teaches you by reading plently of docs, going through personal projects and more! 
> The answer is always no, if you don't ask 😄
